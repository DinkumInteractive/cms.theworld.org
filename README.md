## Setup

This repository uses Lando for local development. Run the following commands:

1. Set up lando:
`lando start`

2. Retrieve and export of the database and place it in the `reference/` directory. If a database export does not exist within this directory the script will attempt to pull the database from Pantheon's dev environment. After a successful import it will find and replace all domain records in the database with your local domain. Finally, import and configuration bundles saved to `wp-content/config`
`lando refresh`

To use the helper script provided you will need to have `npm` installed. These commands are bash scripts located in the `./scripts` directory and defined in `package.json`.

`npm run local` - Imports configuration bundles and verifies all domain records in the database use your local domain.

`npm run refresh` - See the `lando refresh` description above.
